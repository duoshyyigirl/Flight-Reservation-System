# Flight-Reservation-System
Final project of course Design of Software System. 

## Purpose of the system
World Plane, Inc. (hereafter identified as WPI) serves people as an flight ticket reservation company. It has its own airline flight system, but once it relied on the Travel Agency airline reservation system. WPI decided to develop a small scaled application for customer by Java language, so that customers can order flight on WPI’s Retail Customer airline reservation System. 

## Scope of the system 
This system offers help for customers to create airline reservations with World Plane, Inc.. Also, the system supports sorting flights by either price or time.  In addition, the system is to support both one way and round trip flights, initially queryable by departure date.  Lastly, when reserving the seat, the system will support selection of which class the seat belongs to and etc.

## Core System Functionalities
The application will be able to:
 
Allow a customer make an airline reservation to travel from a departure airport to a destination airport of their choice.
Select first class or economy seating for travel.
Provide a series of connecting flights with a maximum of two stopovers between departure and arrival place.
Choose one-way or round-trip flight.
Show the departure time and arrival time of each leg.  
Search for flights using departure date, arrival dates and respective time windows within each.
Sort the list of flight according to price or travel time.
Select flights and confirm the selection prior to the reservation being made.
Show the price of flight between the departure and arrival place.
Select flights and confirm before the reservation being made.

##  Objectives and Success Criteria of the Project 
The success of the application depends upon meeting the following core set of objectives:
 
The System will allow a customer  to reserve a flight specified by:
Flight Type (one-way or round-trip)
Departure airport
Arrival airport
Seating class (consistent throughout all legs of the flight)
Departure date
The System will show customer a list of all results sorted according to price or travel time that customer entered in.
The System will allow customer to review flight information before making a final reservation decision.
